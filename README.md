# Mancala

## Intro
Mancala is a turn-based board game that has existed since before the first century AD. Its name stems from the Arabic word "naqala", which means "to move" or "to transfer". Athough the game's exact origins are unknown, it is believed that Arabic traders brought the game to Africa, from where it has now gained global adoption. There are several variations of the game's rules, some of which are location-specific. A traditional Mancala board contains twelve pits (two rows of six) in the middle, as well as two larger rectangles (called "mancalas") at the end for each of the two players. 48 small implements (stones, beads, shells, etc.) are used as gamepieces.
